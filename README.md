# Eat-Da-Burger

This was a challenging homework assignment, and I did have to leverage past class activities to help me get it this close to completion. That being said, this being the first true full-stack assignment I have done from the ground up, I feel pretty accomplished. 

The last issue I was having with this assignment, and haven't been able to complete at this point, was to be able to have the updateOne feature working to be able to take a burger from the devoured side to the un-devoured side. I do hope to complete that piece of the functionality in the future.
